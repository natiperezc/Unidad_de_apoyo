      <description>&lt;p&gt;Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are well-known contributors to soil aggregation and nutrient cycling functions, but we still know little about their capacity to resist or recover from persistent disturbance. Rangeland management may deteriorate these functions by affecting the activity of soil biota, including AM fungi, among other consequences. If affected, some soil properties show recovery when management stops and natural regeneration is allowed. We conducted an experiment to evaluate if the functions related to soil aggregation and promotion of exocellular enzymatic activities associated with AM fungal communities had been affected by rangeland management and, if they had, whether they recovered with successional time when management stopped. AM fungal communities from ten sites with different successional ages in a tropical dry forest region were inoculated to the same host growing in pots divided by mesh into a plant compartment and an AM mycelium compartment. We examined soil stable aggregates fractions and enzymatic activities produced or promoted by AM fungi. Soil aggregation changed significantly only after the study had run for 3 years, was higher in the hyphosphere than in the root compartment, and showed a low but positive relation with the successional age of the communities. The activity of phosphatase, but not casein-protease and beta-glucosidase, increased with successional age. Therefore, soil aggregation and enzyme activities associated with AM fungal communities seemed resilient because casein-protease and beta-glucosidase were unchanged, and aggregation and phosphatase were reduced by rangeland management but recovered with successional time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to analyze spatial patterns of soil ectomycorrhizal fungal (EMF) communities at the local scale in a subtropical pine-oak forest located in the Nearctic-Neotropical transition in central Mexico, to underpin biodiversity conservation strategies in forest fragments of this region. We used a spatially-explicit nested square sampling design with the same sampling representativeness at all scales and replicated three times. We detected 674 EMF OTUs within 19,200m2 and 65 OTUs on average per sample. Seventy percent of OTUs were detected in only 1e4 samples. Average community similarity was below 5%, showed minor change within 14 and 339m distance and increased with the spatial grain used to compare the data. We found a high species-area relationship and beta diversity coefficients for soil fungi indicating that, at the local scale, increasing area by a constant factor of four represented an in- crease in OTU richness by a factor of two.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal spore communities of a tropical dry forest ecosystem show resilience to land-use change</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We explored the resilience of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) communities of a tropical dry forest ecosystem to land use as pastures. We compared spore community species richness, composition, abundance, and similarity between old-growth forests and active pastures, as a measure of resistance and examined the trajectory of change in successional fields when pasture use stopped to evaluate re- covery. Despite a few changes in species richness, community composition and structure were strikingly similar in all sites, including the active pastures. The spore communities were considered resistant to land use as pastures and showed minor changes along succession when management stopped. We found a significant negative relation between the frequency of Diversisporales and Glomerales indicating a selective species turnover driven mainly by the families Gigasporaceae and Glomeraceae. This was, however, unrelated to land use or successional time. These results suggest the AMF communities of this ecosystem seem resilient to management as pastures.&lt;/p&gt;
